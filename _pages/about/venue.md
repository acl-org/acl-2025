## About Vienna

Vienna developed from early Celtic and Roman settlements into a Medieval and Baroque city, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It played an essential role as a leading European music centre, from the great age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. The historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque castles and gardens, as well as the late-19th-century Ringstrasse lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.

### Must-Sees in Vienna

On a trip along the Ringstrasse, you pass the Vienna State Opera, the Museum of Art History and its counterpart, the Museum of Natural History, the Parliament, the Burgtheater, and the City Hall.

Right in the heart of the city, the Gothic St. Stephen's Cathedral casts its shadows through narrow cobblestone streets. The palaces and parks of the Habsburg era - Sch√∂nbrunn Palace with the Gloriette and the zoo, Belvedere Palace, and the Hofburg palace - give the city an imperial air, enriched by beautiful buildings from the Art Nouveau period.
