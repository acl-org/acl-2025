## Overview

ACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.

Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.

## Paper Submission Information

Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 February cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 February cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to ACL 2025 via the [conference commitment site](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2025/Conference).

## ACL 2025 Theme Track: Generalization of NLP Models

Following the success of the ACL 2020-2024 Theme tracks, we are happy to announce that ACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP. 

Generalization is crucial for ensuring that models behave robustly, reliably, and fairly when making predictions on data different from their training data. Achieving good generalization is critically important for models used in real-world applications, as they should emulate human-like behavior. Humans are known for their ability to generalize well, and models should aspire to this standard. 

The theme track invites empirical and theoretical research and position and survey papers reflecting on the Generalization of NLP Models. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:

- How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness?
- What factors affect the generalization of NLP models?
- What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models?
- While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard?

The theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session for this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards.

## Two-Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to ACL 2025

ACL 2025 will use [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the [Open Review](https://openreview.net/) platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:
- Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors;
- Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., ACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.

ACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with *CL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.

The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.

## Mandatory Reviewing Workload

As the pace of research in the field continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here. As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.

## Paper Submission Details

Both long and short paper submissions should follow all of the [ARR submission requirements](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-information), including:
- [Long Papers](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#long-papers) (8 pages) and [Short Papers](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#short-papers) (4 pages)
- [Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#instructions-for-two-way-anonymized-review)
- [Authorship](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#authorship)
- [Citation and Comparison](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#citation-and-comparison)
- [Multiple Submission Policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#multiple-submission-policy), [Resubmission Policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#resubmission-policy), and [Withdrawal Policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#withdrawal-policy)
- [Ethics Policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#ethics-policy) including the [responsible NLP research checklist](https://aclrollingreview.org/responsibleNLPresearch)
- [Limitations](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#limitations)
- [Paper Submission and Templates](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-and-templates)
- [Optional Supplementary Materials](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#optional-supplementary-materials-appendices-software-and-data)
Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.

**Following the [ACL and ARR policies](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/report-acl-committee-anonymity-policy), there is no anonymity period requirement.**

At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected ACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to ACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than ACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to ACL 2025.

## Presentation at the Conference

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection. Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.
