## About Vienna

Through its role as the imperial capital and residence of the Austrian Empire from 1804 onwards, Vienna became a cultural and political center of Europe. The historic center of Vienna and Schönbrunn Palace are now UNESCO World Heritage sites. With around 7.5 million tourists annually and around 18.9 million overnight stays in 2024, Vienna is one of the most visited cities in Europe.
