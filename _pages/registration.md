The ACL Exec have put together the following 3 registration types, each with an option for Authors to register their paper to present at the conference and cover their hard costs of presenting at the conference while allowing non-presenting authors and attendees a discounted rate for future advancement of the CL & NLP Communities ability to attend. 
     
1. Industrial/Non-Academic
2. Academic 
3. Student
    
**Registration is officially open, register now at:**
[https://acl.swoogo.com/acl2025](https://acl.swoogo.com/acl2025)

In order to keep prices affordable for students, the ACL Board has introduced a three-tier system, listed below.	

## Authors Registration Details

Author Register Paper (for presentation) Industrial/Non-Academic, Academic or Student. All Registration fees cover up to 2 accepted papers. Additional registration fees apply for any papers above 2.    
 
At least one author of each accepted paper to an ACL conference (ACL, NAACL, EACL, AACL, or EMNLP) must register their paper to present at the conference. 
Exceptions to the statement above:    
- Accepted Finding that are not being presented. (All findings being presented must have 1 author register their paper to present)    
- Workshop shared tasked papers do not need to register their paper to present.    

**Please note: All conference attendees must be registered to attend the conference. If an author is not registered, they will not be able to access the venue or Underline site.**    

Note that all Paper registration fees are based on the actual hard cost to the conference.     
- In-person registration fee reflects the attendees’ hard costs of food & beverage (breaks, welcome reception, and social dinner) along with meeting space, av or poster presentation equipment.     
- Virtual attendees’ registration fees reflect the virtual costs (internet, AV, content management, platforms).     

**Author Deadlines for Registering the Paper to Present:**  

To assist the program chairs and committee with publishing the conference details for the program and Anthology, we ask all authors to register no later than the following dates:     

- Papers Accepted to the Main Conference which includei– Main Conference, Findings, CL/TACL, DEMOS, Industry & SRW – June 25th in order to not be removed from the proceedings
 
- Workshop Accepted Papers - no later than the Early Registration deadline of July 2nd. Note this is when early registration ends so cost will go up after this date.    
 
All Authors presenting their paper at a workshop must have 1 author register your paper. If attending the full conference, select the Registered Paper option and follow the prompts to select your attendee type.    

Workshop Exception for registering your paper would be shared task papers. Shared Tasks are not required to register your paper.    

Since workshop notifications can come after early registration ends, there will be a way to add a paper to a registration once you receive the notification.    
 
Paper registration instructions, policy and fees are below the conference rates listed after membership and cancellation policies.    

## Implementation

- Every paper will be assigned a “Registration ID”
- When participants register, they will have the choice to register as

1. Author Paper Presenter
2. Regular
3. Student

- Please note all Accepted Papers accepted to the Main Conference must be attached to 1 Author Paper Present. These fees are to aid in covering the hard costs of the paper being presented at the conference.
- When registering you will select your paper title in the dropdown box this will guarantee that your paper has been registered. (Papers not registered for the conference with the registration type Author Paper Presenter will be pulled from the conference and will not be published). Furthermore, if a paper accepted to finding is presenting, they would follow the same guidelines with the exception that Findings not presenting are not required to register for the conference. Therefore, if a Finding paper shows it’s being presented in person, and they are not registered 2 weeks before the conference, then they will be removed from the program as a presenter.
- Each paper ID must be linked to an Author/Paper Presenter (Regular or Student) Registration. However, a student author on the paper registered under a student fee is permitted to present the registered paper.

## Further Details

Invited speakers and panelists for the main conference and workshops will receive an invited speaker code according to policy. Once the codes are used, all additional invited speakers will register as an attendee. Please note that invited speakers do not include ACL membership.

- Workshop papers will also be included in this scheme, with the exception of shared task papers which do not require their paper to be registered. Attendees must be registered.
- Since workshop notifications can come after early registration ends, there will be a way to add a paper to a registration.
- Authors of Findings papers who choose to present their papers at a workshop or at the main conference will need to register at a Author/Paper Presenter (Regular or Student) for either the Workshop Only they are presenting at or Full Conference if presenting at the Main Conference. If your paper is presented at workshop but you wish to attend the full conference you will need to register
- D&I subsidies will continue to be available to offset registration costs and travel for those in need.
- Papers where all authors are in regions covered by the free/sliding-scale virtual registration can be registered under the free/sliding-scale registration fee.

## Membership Policy

The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2025) ACL member. So, in addition to the registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2025 paid member. Your ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.

## Cancellation Policy

Cancellation of registration one month or more prior to the conference (June 27, 2025, or before), will be refunded the full amount paid (Minus up to $50 processing fee).

Cancellations up to three weeks prior to the conference (July 4, 2025) will be refunded the ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200. 
Cancellations 2 weeks prior to the start of the conference (July 11, 2025), and all no-shows, will not be refunded any amount. They will be able to retain the current full year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and have access virtually on Underline.

Exceptions: Cancellation due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness that prevents travel to the conference will be refunded the full amount paid (Minus up to $50 processing fee) regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office but no longer than a week after the conference. The registrant must submit documentation supporting the above cancellation exceptions.     

## Code of Ethics Policy

ACL adopts the ACM Code of Ethics (https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) in the version adopted June 22nd, 2018, by the ACM Council. In its application to ACL, it is to be read in the contextually appropriate interpretation, e.g., “ACM member” is to be read as “ACL member”. Sec 4.2 should be read as follows:

“4.2 Treat violations of the Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACL. Each ACL member should encourage and support adherence by all members of the CL/NLP community regardless of ACL membership. ACL members who recognize a breach of the Code should consider reporting the violation to the ACL, which may result in remedial action.”

“The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of the ACL. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.

It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.”

## Anti-Harassment Policy

ACL 2025 adheres to the ACL Anti-Harassment Policy. Any participant who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any current member of the ACL Professional Conduct Committee or Jennifer Rachford, who is usually available at the registration desk of the conference. Please be assured that if you approach us, your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.

For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our events and in our programs.
