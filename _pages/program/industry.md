## Keynotes

### From Words to Worlds: NLP for Game Creation and Interaction**
#### Lucia Specia

![Lucia Specia](/assets/images/speaker/Lucia_Specia.jpg){: .align-center .speaker-photo}

* <small>**Abstract:** The gaming industry is a leading force in global entertainment, surpassing the size of the
music and film industries combined. With over 3 billion people playing games, there’s bigger and bigger demand for fresh, high-quality, and immersive experiences. At the same time, user-generated games have become a core component of major gaming platforms, fostering creativity and diversification. These developments present significant opportunities for AI research and AI-driven tools designed to support gaming, from AAA studios to independent creators. In this talk, I will highlight some of these opportunities, focusing on three areas involving language: 1) Speech-driven animation, where we predict lip sync, expression, and head motion of a character from audio to animate photo-realistic characters; 2) Low-resource language code generation, where we build a code generation model for Verse, a new language designed specifically for programming interactive 3D worlds, games, and simulations; and 3) Safety of interactive NPCs at scale, where we design safety strategies to support the deployment of LLMs for speech to speech in-game (Fortnite) conversations between players and NPCs..</small>

* <small>**Bio:**  Lucia Specia is Senior Director of Research Engineering at Epic Games and Professor of Natural
Language Processing at Imperial College London. Her work focuses on various aspects of data-driven approaches to multimodal and multilingual context models, with applications including machine translation, image captioning, visual question answering, quality estimation, and content moderation, among others. In 2021, she founded Contex.ai to build multimodal content moderation models for real world
applications, focusing in the gaming industry. She now leads a team of research engineers at Epic Games delivering ML solutions across automation and business optimization, safety and security, user experience and content creation. She received a PhD from the University of Sao Paulo and has held positions at University of Sheffield, Meta, and Xerox Research.</small>


### We Can't Do it Alone**
#### Leon Derczynski

![Leon Derczynski](/assets/images/speaker/Leon_Derczynski.jpg){: .align-center .speaker-photo}

* <small>**Abstract:** Industry and academic research each have their own deficiences and blindspots, and both rely heavily on each other. This talk explores common themes and describes each side's view and what they miss for each theme. We will discuss the role in society, the role in research, which narratives work (and don't), the role in peer review (and its role for us), and where the hard workers, sceptics, and sociopaths fit in either case. All this comes together to form a positive view of good open collaborations, and some concrete advice on how to give and get the most value out of interactions with the other side.</small>

* <small>**Bio:** Leon Derczynski is principal research scientist for LLM security at NVIDIA and prof in computer science at ITU Copenhagen. He was written inches, if not kilograms, of papers, and won similar quantities of awards etc. Prof. Derczynski has led policy efforts in academia, industry, and civil society. He has held affiliations at a dozen organisations in the past decade, including startups, universities, corporations, and non-profits; built research programmes at both a leading university and a leading corporation; and he retains a deep love of both university and industry research.
