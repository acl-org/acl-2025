Anna Rogers is an Associate Professor in the NLPNorth research group at the IT University of Copenhagen. She holds a PhD degree in Computational Linguistics from the University of Tokyo, followed by postdocs in Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing (University of Massachusetts) and in Social Data Science (University of Copenhagen). Her work focuses on interpretability and robustness of NLP applications based on Large Language Models, as well as their sociotechnical impacts.

**Yulia Tsvetkov**

Yulia Tsvetkov is an associate professor at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at University of Washington. Her research group works on fundamental advancements to large language models, multilingual NLP, and AI ethics/safety. This research is motivated by a unified goal: to extend the capabilities of human language technology beyond individual populations and across language boundaries, thereby making NLP tools available to *all* users. Prior to joining UW, Yulia was an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University and before that a postdoc at Stanford. Yulia is a recipient of NSF CAREER, Sloan Fellowship, Okawa Research award, and multiple paper awards and runner-ups at NLP, ML, and CSS conferences.

**Hinrich Schuetze**

Hinrich Schuetze is Professor at the Center for Information and Language Processing at LMU Munich.  His lab is engaged in research on interpretability, in particular, how language models learn, represent and access knowledge about languages and the world.  His research has been funded by NSF, the German National Science Foundation and the European Research Council (ERC Advanced Grant).  Hinrich is coauthor of two textbooks (Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing and Introduction to Information Retrieval), a fellow of HessianAI, ELLIS (the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems) and ACL (Association for  
Computational Linguistics) and (co-)awardee of several best paper awards, including the ACL 2023 25-year test of time award.

**Diyi Yang**

Diyi Yang is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. Her research focuses on human-centered natural language processing and human-AI interaction.  She is a recipient of  Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship (2021),  NSF CAREER Award (2022), an ONR Young Investigator Award (2023), and a Sloan Research Fellowship (2024).  Her work has received multiple paper awards or nominations at top NLP and HCI conferences.

**Thamar Solorio**

Thamar Solorio is a professor in the NLP department at MBZUAI where she also serves as Senior Director of Graduate Student Education and Postdoctoral Affairs. Her research interests include NLP for low-resource settings, in particular, in the context of multilingual data. More recently, she has been exploring language and vision problems with a focus on social intelligence. She served two terms as an elected board member of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics (NAACL) and recently stepped down from being co-Editor in Chief of the ACL Rolling Review Initiative (ARR). She was PC co-chair for NAACL 2019 and the general chair of the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).
